        <p>
          Becoming a vendor on BPrents is so easy and free, we eliminated the
          struggle of trying to find a way to rent/hire/lease out whatever you
          wish to having little or no trust issues. We’ve created a platform
          that allows vendors who really can be anyone, including those with
          high level experience in the rental industry and those with zero
          experience in the rental industry to all benefit and connect with
          different interested clients and customers for your different items or
          services at any given time directly and at your own terms. We are
          aware of the several uncertainties in this Industry having been in the
          industry for not less than a decade, we have provided some basic
          premise of information that would guide any novice to starting and
          running a safe, secure and minimal risk rental experience using
          BPrents.ng having little or no worries so about theft and damages of
          your properties, assets or equipment. These Guidelines are as follows
          :
        </p>

        <br />
        <li>
          Vendors should endeavour to properly and strategically tag their
          movable assets, properties and equipment with tags identifiable by
          them at all times. This tags could be inform of names, marks, engraved
          writings or even printed. This is to ensure that at all times vendor
          can confidently identify his equipment or property and distinguish
          between his original property and another’s. This also is to help
          vendor guard against theft. Therefore no matter the kind or type of
          asset vendor should find a way of strategically engraving proper tags
          on such asset or equipment.
        </li>
        <li>
          While posting on BPrents.ng there is an option for description which
          is not limited to any certain amount of words. Vendors are allowed to
          properly and clearly stipulate their terms of hire, for high valued
          and easily movable properties or assets vendors are advised to
          indicate a Refundable Damage Fee charge which should be less than the
          worth and rental cost of the equipment, this fee should be paid by
          client before vendor hands over the item and upon return of the item
          vendor is to cross check to make sure the condition of the asset is ok
          after which vendor owes the responsibility to refund the fee to
          client, otherwise if the asset is damaged vendor withholds the fee and
          vendor has the right to charge customer extra depending on level of
          damage incurred also dependent on initially agreement between both
          parties.
        </li>
        <li>
          Vendors are advised to request for Valid means of Identification from
          Clients/customers depending on the kind of item, equipment or property
          to be rented out. This is to note that, there are already some popular
          rentable items in the industry with a particular system of operation
          and don’t require any identification from any party, been that vendors
          normally supply this items to clients and pickup after use, thus most
          of this items require expertise to function. Therefore a photocopy of
          this mode of Identification can be in vendors custody till client
          returns item after which vendor hands over. NB it is totally illegal
          for anyone to make secretly keep identification of another citizen
          without his/her consent and doesn’t return or makes further copies of
          that, it’s tagged a criminal offence. Therefore once the rental
          experience is complete vendors must return mode of identification
          submitted to them to client.
        </li>
        <li>
          For vendors in the vehicle rental space, this is not a new category in
          the Nigerian rental industry and so just for the sake of those who
          aren’t familiar, Vendors are not advised to handover there vehicle car
          keys to clients under any circumstances, the Vendor is obliged to
          provide a professional Chauffeur or Driver or Captain or Pilot or
          Operator as the case or vehicle may be whom vendor trust and is
          familiar with to take charge of the vehicle and clients experience and
          cost of the chauffeur is to be handled by the Vendor as part of the
          charges for renting the Vehicle. Vendors are also advised to install
          tracker devices in several strategic hidden areas of the vehicle for
          further insurance.
        </li>
        <li>
          Vendors are highly advised to do proper Insurance on every item,
          property, equipment, asset and service displayed on the platform for
          rental/hire/lease, this is wise to protect vendors against any
          unforeseen circumstances.
        </li>
        <li>
          Vendors are advised to make delivery to clients or customers
          themselves to know the location of use of their item or property, also
          vendors are advised not to immediately mobilize unless proper and
          clear discussion and confirmation have been made by client. The rental
          industry demands a booking fee to mobilize vendors, therefore vendors
          should endeavour to keep proper records of bookings already made to
          avoid mix-up and disappointment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Vendors are not advised to request for online payments or transfers
          before properly discussing and confirming physically the existence of
          the goods in their possession to client. Any report that comes in of a
          vendor who scammed a client that vendor would be immediately have his
          account blocked and immediate and urgent report would be sent out to
          the different security arms and parastatals and urgent investigation
          would begin search for that individual. And this same goes vice versa
          with clients, so always deal confidently and transparently on
          BPrents.ng.
        </li>
        <li>
          Vendors are encouraged to always ask their clients to leave feedbacks
          and ratings for them on the platform as this adds to the general
          ratings by the site, and vendors with more positive ratings would be
          recommended highly to customers by the site, why vendors with negative
          and poor reviews would be blocked after a giving period of minor
          probation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Regular, Adequate and Proper Maintenance is to be done on the
          different items, assets, properties, equipment advertised for rent on
          this platform as the company would be doing checks on its vendors and
          items displayed to properly check and certify their working
          conditions, and anyone that doesn’t meet up to the market standard
          would immediately be taken off until the such item be rectified. If
          one doesn’t know where and how to conduct proper maintenance checks
          you can send a mail support@bprents.ng and the company would assist
          you.
        </li>
        <li>
          Vendors are advised to prepare proper documentation to be endorsed by
          both them and clients during rental for both records and security
          sake. This could be inform of an invoice that should stipulate the
          details of the lease/hire/rental or a proper legal form that having
          the details of the rent/hire/lease and proper documentation of
          identification of the client. If vendor cannot prepare this kindly
          send a mail to
          <a href="mailto:support@bprents.ng">support@bprents.ng</a> stating
          your request and a form format for BPrents would be sent to your mail
