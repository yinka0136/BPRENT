        <h4><strong>SERVICE</strong></h4>
        <div>
          The Platform is an online service that allows users to create and
          publish announcements, to view announcements published by other users,
          to communicate with other users using the contact details provided in
          the announcements.<br /><br />
          The Administrator itself is not an importer, manufacturer,
          distributor, renter or seller of any item, as well as not a provider
          of any service posted by users on the Platform. In addition, the
          Administrator is neither a marketer nor a person acting on user's
          behalf with respect to the marketing of any goods or services posted
          on the Platform. The actual rental contracts or services contracts are
          entered into directly between the users, and the Administrator itself
          is not a party to such transactions. The Administrator provides users
          with an opportunity to communicate.<br /><br />
          Users shall be solely responsible to collect and remit any applicable
          taxes resulting from the rent of their goods or services posted on the
          Platform.<br /><br />
          The Administrator reserves a right to delete or block access to
          announcements posted by users without any notice in the event of:<br />

          <ol>
            <li>
              receiving of mandatory judgments of competent public authorities;
            </li>
            <li>
              claim of a holder of intellectual property rights to terminate
              infringement of his/her rights by a user on the Platform;
            </li>
            <li>
              infringements of rights or legal interests of other users, legal
              entities, or individuals upon their reasonable request;
            </li>
            <li>
              detecting that announcement posted by user on the Platform
              breaches these Terms or any applicable law, regulation, rule or
              standard.
            </li>
          </ol>

          The Administrator is authorized to delete or block announcements of
          users regardless of providing a user with the relevant
          substantiation.<br /><br />
          The Administrator retains the right to implement any changes to the
          Service (whether to free or paid features) at any time, with or
          without notice. You acknowledge that a variety of Administrator’s
          actions may impair or prevent you from accessing the Service at
          certain times and/or in the same way, for limited periods or
          permanently, and agree that the Administrator has no responsibility or
          liability as a result of any such actions or results, including,
          without limitation, for the deletion of, or failure to make available
          to you, any content or services.<br /><br />
          Each user of the Service is solely responsible for any and all his or
          her User Content (as defined below). Because we do not control the
          User Content, you acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible
          for any User Content and we make no guarantees regarding the accuracy,
          currency, suitability, or quality of any User Content, and we assume
          no responsibility for any User Content. Your interactions with other
          Service users are solely between you and such user. You agree that the
          Administrator will not be responsible for any loss or damage incurred
          as a result of any such interactions. If there is a dispute between
          you and any Service user, we are under no obligation to become
          involved.<br /><br />
          The Service may contain links to third-party websites or resources and
          advertisements for third parties (collectively, "Third Party Ads").
          Such Third-Party Ads are not under the control of the Administrator
          and the Administrator is not responsible for any Third- Party Ads. The
          Administrator provides these Third-Party Ads only as a convenience and
          does not review, approve, monitor, endorse, warrant, or make any
          representations with respect to Third-Party Ads. Advertisements and
          other information provided by online properties to which the Third
          Party Ads lead, may not be wholly accurate. You acknowledge sole
          responsibility for and assume all risk arising from your use of any
          such online properties. When you link to third party online
          properties, the applicable service provider's terms and policies,
          including privacy and data gathering practices, govern you. You should
          make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before
          proceeding with any transaction with any third party. Your
          transactions and other dealings with Third-Party Ads that are found on
          or through the Service, including payment and delivery of related
          goods or services, are solely between you and such third party.<br /><br />
          You hereby release us, our officers, employees, agents, and successors
          from claims, demands any and all losses, damages, rights, claims, and
          actions of any kind including personal injuries, death, and property
          damage, that is either directly or indirectly related to or arises
          from any interactions with or conduct of any Service users or any
          Third Party Ads.
